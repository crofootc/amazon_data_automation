# Amazon_Data_Automation

This application was developed for Vooray in order to help automate their process of analyzing sales data. The process was tedious and consisted of downloading the necessary documents from Amazon and then taking the time to format them properly for analysis. The application automates this process by running a python script that will take the information from the csv and uploads it to a mySQL database. It does error and duplicate checking as well to make sure the data is accurate. 

It is estimated that this application reduces the overall time it takes to prepare the data from about 2 hours to thirty minutes. Although the application takes thirty minutes (this varies depending on the size of the data) the time it takes an employee is seconds. As a result the time spent by employees on managing the data is reduced from about 2 hours to thirty seconds. 

The repository consists of the following:
- database files: these are the python scripts to setup the database and make any necessary alterations
- documentation: extensive documentation is included about the technical aspects of the project as well as overview presentation
- test_data: dummy data is provided to test the process
- script_c.py: the application
- vooray_application.ipynb: jupyter notebook demonstrating the script.

For more technical questions please refer to the commented code or the documentation.
